# Project Overview: Analyzing Chelsea's Performance Decline Post-Champions League Victory in 2021

# Introduction
In 2021, Chelsea Football Club reached the pinnacle of European football by winning the UEFA Champions League. However, since that historic triumph, the club's performance has seen a noticeable decline, raising concerns among fans and analysts alike. This project aims to investigate the factors contributing to Chelsea's struggles by analyzing data from the 2021 English Premier League (EPL) season. The primary focus is on the age distribution of players and how it has evolved, particularly comparing the squad composition in 2021 to the 2024 season.

# Motivation
The motivation behind this analysis stems from Chelsea's inconsistency on the pitch following their Champions League success. Understanding the underlying causes of this downturn is crucial, especially regarding squad composition, age distribution, and the reliance on younger players. By comparing the number of underage (under 20) players in 2021 and 2024, the analysis seeks to uncover trends that may have influenced the club's performance.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is the 2021 EPL dataset, which includes various attributes such as player age, position, club, nationality, and performance metrics. The data provides a comprehensive view of the players representing each club during the 2021 season, enabling a detailed examination of Chelsea's squad relative to other teams.

# Key Findings

# Age Distribution in Chelsea's 2021 Squad:
In 2021, Chelsea's squad had a limited number of under-20 players, with most of the squad comprising experienced players in their prime (ages 25-30). This balance of youth and experience contributed to their success in the Champions League.

# Changes in Squad Composition by 2024:
By 2024, Chelsea's squad has seen a significant shift in age distribution, with a noticeable increase in the number of under-20 players. While youth can bring energy and potential, the lack of experience among these younger players may have contributed to the club's struggles in maintaining consistent form.

# Impact on Performance:
The increased reliance on younger players may have affected the team's ability to perform consistently at the highest level. The data suggests that while Chelsea had a well-balanced squad in 2021, the shift towards a younger, less experienced lineup in 2024 may be a factor in their decline.
